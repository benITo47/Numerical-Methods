2. **LU Decomposition and Matrix Inversion**
3. **Iterative Methods for Solving Systems of Linear Equations using Jacobi's Method**
4. **Diagonalization of the Energy Operator Matrix in 2D**
5. **Eigenvalue and Eigenvector Determination for Symmetric Matrices using the Power Method with Hotelling's Reduction**
6. **Root Finding for Polynomials using the Iterative Division Method (Newton's Method)**
7. **Lagrange Interpolation with Optimization of Node Positions**
8. **Spline Interpolation through Second Derivative Values at Nodes**
9. **Approximation in the Basis of Gram Polynomials**
10. **Function Minimization using Simulated Annealing**
